## Hospital Management System

The project is part of the course project for the course [CS 315: Principles Of Database Systems](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/CS315.html) taken under [Prof. Sumit Ganguly](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/sganguly/) in the **Spring'22** offering at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.

## Purpose

The purpose of our application is to make the management of a hospital more robust and efficient. A hospital generates a lot of data in its everyday working. This includes appointment data, in patient stay data, prescription data and much more.
Our hospital management system aims to make the handling of such data including processes like adding new data, updating existing data, deleting redundant data, viewing the data in a particular way very easy to use and efficient.
Some of the domains in which our application aims to help the hospital are: 
1. Appointment Management
-  This includes making appointments keeping in mind the schedule of doctors, nurses, and other operating rooms like operation theaters, X-ray rooms, MRI rooms etc.
2. Billing Management
- This includes generating the overall bill for a patient, including the bill for his stay,
the bill for his appointments/procedures and the bill for his prescriptions. 
3. Prescription Management
- This includes managing that is creating, updating and deleting the prescriptions of medicines made to a particular patient by a doctor.
4. Discharge Summary
- This includes creating a summary of all the appointments that a particular patient
has made, and also all the prescriptions he has been given. 
5. Operating Room Management
- This includes being able to check the availability of the operating rooms.

## Vision
The vision of this application was to make it easier for all the different users in a hospital to work with the large amount of information that is generated in a hospital on a daily basis. This includes enabling the administrative staff to make the appointments, check the availability of doctors, rooms etc. quickly and easily. Furthermore it also includes making it easier for both doctors and patients to check their commitments, and/or update them.
Summarizing the above, the vision of this application was to enable the different users involved in such an environment to properly communicate data through a wellâ€“structured application.

## Web App Tech Stack:

### Front End:
For designing user interfaces and handling the view layer for our web project, we use `React.js`, an open-source JS toolkit. We choose React because it allows us to make reusable user interface components.

### Back End:
For creating the backend interface of our application we have used the Express framework in `NodeJs`. Express is a Node.js web application framework that offers a comprehensive collection of functionality for building web and mobile applications. The express framework allows to write handlers for requests with various `HTTP` verbs at various routes and integrate with "view" rendering engines to provide replies by populating templates with data.

### Web App Database:
For creating the database we have used relational database `MySQL`. Due to its speed, versatility, and durability, MySQL is a prominent open source database management system used in online web applications. It also allows us to define relations between different tables of our database to query the required data and display it on the frontend.
